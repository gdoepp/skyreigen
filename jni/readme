This application uses the library 

http://www.naughter.com/aa.html 

that implements algorithms from the book "Astronomical Algorithms" by Jean Meeus.

Please unpack aaplus.zip in this directory (or create symbolic links to the *.h/*.cpp files).
The latest version is 1.99. 

The visibility calculations are taken from http://mhuss.com/AstroCpp/AstroCpp.zip

Please unzip at least VisLimit.h and VisLimit.cpp from AstroCpp.zip.

The java classes and the SWIG wrappers can be generated with SWIG and the files in swiggen.

You need to have SWIG and the Android NDK installed. Then you can use the script build.sh (set NDK_HOME) to 
generate the JNI interface and the C++-wrappers, and to compile the native libraries.

Please check whether the generated java sources compile. Currently, there is a name clash because of camel case 
in CAASaturnRingDetails. The first 'B' in the setter/getter must be changed to 'B2'.
